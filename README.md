# Python Dash Sample Application

### Summary
A simple sample application using Python Dash along with Seaborn Visualation module MPG dataset. Think of it as my "Hello, World" to Dash.

This application written specifically to prove out Dash callbacks when used in conjunction with dash_table and DCC Graph.  It mimics the behavior of Power Bi chart when used in conjunction with a matrix in
that the matrix records change when the chart filter is used.
